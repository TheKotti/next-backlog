When played as a shooter it's a very standard early 2000s shooter in the style of RTCW or Red Faction, not remarkable but alright if those kind of shooters are your thing. Humor rarely landed, seems the game doesn't have any comedic timing and every joke gets drawn out for far too long. The same could be said about the game in general, the missions and the cutscenes between them often outstayed their welcome.",

  "comment": "The first half had a decent emphasis on exploration and stealthily navigating the areas in a way that gave a sense of freedom of approach, but in the second half the focus shifted towards more gimmicky sections, boss fights and excessively long lore dumps. Had the pacing been better the plot could've gotten started sooner and the gameplay could've remained interesting until the end, but sadly that was not the case.\n\nAnd the controls... Pressure sensitive buttons were a terrible idea and even without them the rest of the controls were often counter intuitive at best.\n\nDespite all that, it was at least fairly unique and I can respect that.",

Overall hacking things like cameras and vehicles was a nice addition, even if phones were excessively strong as a distraction mechanic.\n\nWriting was also surprisingly fun in a campy way which I wasn't expecting. What wasn't fun were the imprecise controls that often made carefully sneaking around frustrating and the occasional open world padding.",

  "comment": "The camouflage system sets MGS3 apart from other stealth games and I'm surprised it hasn't been copied more often. The implementation isn't perfect as the only reason not to optimize the camo every 10 steps is that between food and healing there's more than enough menuing to begin with, but the idea is still neat and it works well enough.\n\nThe camera and controls and vastly better than in MGS2, but still leave a lot to desire. The pacing is also improved, and while the cutscenes take forever there's at least lengthy chunks of gameplay between the movies.\n\nAlso The End fight is great, one of the best stealth bosses I've seen.",

The escort heavy nature isn't pushed much and usually Yorda just slows the pace down to a needless degree without adding anything interesting. The slow pace isn't helped by lack of automatic checkpoints, meaning that one mistake could easily lead to losing a fair bit of progress which is not fun to repeat and doesn't fit the general feel of the game. There were also one particularly clumsy section with a couple of very awkward jumps that somewhat soured my mood for the following sections.",

If the whole point of the game is balancing a large amount of cargo, why is arranging it completely irrelevant due to auto-arrangement? When most of the game is walking from A to B with little happening in between, why is the story told largely in lenghty text logs that you can only read between walks? The walking could've been a lot more interesting if you actually had to care about the cargo setup and had something to listen to while you walk, but instead the potentially interesting part is automated and the storytelling is ruined.",

  "comment": "Well, it controls better than the previous entries... Unfortunately that doesn't make the gameplay very interesting. The section where you sneak through an active warzone sound interesting in theory, but in practice it just feels messy as the battle doesn't progress until you move, which makes the whole thing feel very inorganic. The octocamo somewhat fixes MGS3's camouflage issue of encouraging changing camo all the time from a menu, by automatically switching to a perfect camo when you stop moving. Not having to open up a menu is nice, but being able to use a perfect camo pretty much constantly is ridiculously strong and ends up taking away from the stealth gameplay.\n\nThe story is like fan fiction trying to bring back everything from the previous games, and considering the ludicrous amount of cutscenes it's shocking how slowly it moves. It wasn't until the end of Act 3 that something actually interesting happened, and the rest of the game never lived up to that. Most of the game relied on nostalgia and tried to build on that rather than actually doing something original.\n\nAlso the constant framerate issues and poor audio balancing in cutscenes should not go unmentioned.",

Nonetheless, the visuals, sounds and gameplay were all very good, dialogue and world are positively weird, and the story is interesting, if barely understandable. As for actual bad stuff, the lack of proper objective log made some missions needlessly obtuse and some of the later missions were too large for their own good especially when going for the true ending.",

The way the fog and the darkness lower the view distance adds to the atmosphere and looks better than most PS1 games, and the soundtrack is great and the directional noise the radio makes avoiding enemies more interesting.\n\nOne thing I appreciate a lot is the map/level design, while the game was ultimately very linear it managed to disguise that a lot of the time by having a larger map that you had to explore to find that correct linear route. It didn't always work in the interior areas but added a lot to the exteriors.\n\nSome of the puzzles sadly didn't hold up as well, I think I got lucky with some of them but I can see people getting stuck on them for hours if their brain doesn't work exactly like the designer's. The (bad) ending was also very abrupt and didn't live up to the rest of the game.",

  "comment": "Definitely not for me. I don't like the feeling of being tunneled towards the one and only path, and Metro takes linearity to a whole new level by often arbitrarily killing you if you try to deviate from the scripted sequence. I first attempted to play on the Ranger mode, but the game was clearly not designed with that in mind as disabling hud also means that you can't tell when you're in a cutscene and when you have \"\"control\"\", as in you have to mash a key to not die.\n\nSneaking is perhaps the best part of the game, but even that is rudimentary at best. Combat on the other hand is just weak, largely thanks to the poor audio design that makes it very easy for rampaging mutants to sneak up on you without making a sound before their attack lands. Plus, the aiming is less than great as horizontal and vertical mouse sensitivities are different and the game doesn't allow changing that. Isn't that exactly the kind of thing \"\"Redux\"\" should fix?\n\nAt least some of the environments looked pretty good.",

  "comment": "Prey has possibly the best designed game world I've ever seen. On one level there's a whole space station and it's exterior, and on another every NPC has at least a name and a workplace and often much more than that. It's the little things like being able to read the same email from the sender and the receiver's workstations that make the world so believable.\n\nWithin individual areas the gameplay is very emergent and exploring is rewarding. Personally I'd prefer the resource management side of things to be a bit less 'shooter' and more like 'survival horror' as even on Hard ammo and health were never really an issue but that's a minor thing.\n\nThe one real issue I have with Prey is that the microgravity sections are considerably worse than everything else in the game. Almost all areas are filled with really good signposting and storytelling, but somehow all that is way worse in the microgravity sections. They were the only times where I enabled objective markers and that's saying something.\n\nStill, a damn good game and a worthy System Shock successor.",

  "comment": "(This was without any mods). Basically everything about the gameplay is so extremely clumsy that it's just not very fun, be it combat, stealth, conversations or any sort of menuing. I can see the open world exploration being the appeal for most people who like this, but I find the post-apocalypse setting is just really dull and colorless so it didn't really invite me to go explore.\n\nI was on board with the main story until all of a sudden it asked me to go meet with a bunch of random factions I had no immediate interest in. It could've been cool had I ran into those factions naturally beforehand or had the option to ignore or meet them, but being forced to interact with them was the worst of both worlds - it sucked the fun out of both aimless exploration and the focused main quest. At that point the main story seemed to completely lose focus and I struggled to maintain interest.\n\nPerhaps the side quests and the DLCs are better, but when the gameplay and the main quest don't convince me, I'm not going to go out of my way to play more. Especially when my brief visit to Old World Blues also left a bad impression with it's unfunny humor and repetitive quests.",

  "comment": "While I like the movement and overall gameplay and it looks and sounds nice, it is a bit \"\"standard\"\" compared to Aragami 1 and the mission design is a huge issue. The game has more than 50 missions in about 10 maps, and in practice some of those maps are revisited up to 7 times in different missions. I'm generally all for reusing areas assuming there are sufficient enough changes in them between missions, but the changes in Aragami 2 are fairly minimal and the mission objectives are very unimaginative. The vast majority of the missions boils down to finding 4-7 key items or NPCs on the map, dealing with them and leaving. Even if the maps weren't repeated, the objectives would get very, very repetitive.\n\nI do hope there's DLC in the future, as the gameplay is good but it's largely going to waste with the main game's repetitive and overly long campaign.",

Perhaps on Normal or even on Easy the game would be more fair and in turn much more enjoyable, but True is just too much.\n\nMassive respect to the one-man-team behind IV in any case for sticking with their vision, listening to feedback and quickly reacting to it and even committing to adding mod support and a level editor later.",

  "comment": "(Rundown 6) Bots, checkpoints and actual story missions were a really big improvement after the early access period. The missions themselves aren't very different from the ones in EA so I didn't feel very compelled to do the secondary ones, but the 4 primary ones were all very good and the game still has great atmosphere and visuals, and even with the bots and checkpoints it's still a good challenge.\n\nWhat I don't like is how the past rundowns still get removed and all the maps from the EA period are now unplayable, but at the same time most of them really weren't very unique to begin with.",

  "comment": "Looks and sounds really good, the combat has a lot more to it than I expected and the open sea is one of the rare open worlds that I really like exploring. There's always something new in the horizon to check out but the world isn't overwhelmingly big.\n\nI'm in the minority who liked most of the Triforce quest as well, as it gave me a good excuse to really check everything out. Some bits could've been cut down, like some of the maps feeling like repeats and the deciphering process being completely unnecessary, but it also could've been made more demanding in other ways. The map of maps seemed like a boring way to do the quest and was given very early so I only used it for the last one but I assume most people don't do that and spoil the quest for themselves. The treasures in the sea being indicated with a pillar of light was also disappointing, I think manually comparing maps to find the right spot would've been much more satisfying.\n\nOverall it's a comfy game that moves mostly at a good pace and doesn't demand too much focus from the player. Nostalgia helps too.",

The most interesting thing about it is that it made me think how a stealth game could work if it borrowed the map structure and resource management from Resident Evil. \n\nA large, gradually opening up building to navigate and persistent enemies and gear that you need to carefully manage over time is something I haven't seen in a stealth game, MGS2 being probably the least far off and still nowhere close. And Cold War wasn't very close either, it just had a large building to navigate over several hours, but it was still split into linear levels where areas are arbitrarily locked off and nothing persists between levels even if the areas are reused. But at least it was leaning in that direction.",

The commitment to the comic book style makes it still look unique and great with all the sound effect texts and picture in picture moments, the guns for the most part feel really satisfying to use and the pacing and the mission/map variety are excellent. And most surprisingly, the stealth sections are actually good which you wouldn't expect from a shooter like this. Good stealth weaponry, stylish footstep indicators and lenient enough AI go a long way.\n\nThe only real criticism I have is that some of the checkpoints are a bit too long and at least on the highest difficulty towards the end taking cheap shots from cover becomes too necessary.",

  "comment": "The N-Gage port of Splinter Cell which turned out to be just a port of the Game Boy Advance version. By far the worst thing are the controls which somehow use most of the 12 buttons available but in the worst ways possible. Running is done by double tapping a direction which leads to lots of accidental sprints and the attack button either melees or pulls out a weapon depending on the context making combat and stealth takedowns very clumsy and unreliable. Instead of dedicated run and melee buttons, we have dedicated buttons for both night- and thermal vision as well as a three buttons that open a menu from which you can switch the vision mode.\n\nOn top of the bad controls, there's no checkpoint indicator and the rooms look very, very similar to one another so when restarting it's often hard to tell where you are or what you were doing. The enemies can also see farther than the players which means getting spotted from off screen happens often, unless you're willing to stop and use the sticky camera every five steps. Overall, this feels like half a step above some of those downloadable phone games from the mid-2000s and the physical release feels like a waste of plastic. At least the music was alright, aside from obviously poor N-Gage sound quality.",

I would've liked to see the story through and the main gameplay was okay considering the PSP roots, but the way items and weapons are tied to the base is just a nightmare. When for the 4th time in 8 hours I was forced to manage Mother Base spreadsheets so I could develop required items/weapons and then was forced to do pointless side missions to pass time for the development to finish, I was done.\n\nThe comicbook style cutscenes looked neat at least, and it somewhat tried to improve the camo system.",

What makes me prefer DaS1 over DeS is that the interconnected world structure is just much more interesting compared to the more level-based one. I do however vastly prefer the DeS structure over what the poorly connected worlds later Souls games went with, and it's also what makes DeS stand out from the rest. Also while the quality of the bosses was all over the place, most of them were very different from one another which I like a lot. What I didn't like a lot was that the runbacks to attempt bosses again sucked exactly as much as expected. Taking it slow and fighting enemies is interesting when you're first exploring the areas, but having to deal with them in order to get back to a boss repeatedly is just a bad time.\n\nEither way, not as good as Dark Souls but different enough in a good way, and better than the sequels. Also the second half of Tower of Latria is amazing, one of my favorite areas in the series.",

The stealth mechanics, movement and AI are all clunkier than in Thief, and all that was very apparent trying this soon after Thief 2X. The custom missions are obviously a big part of the appeal, and what the four missions I tried seemed to have in common was huge size, high loot requirements and a low amount of interactable objects, a combination which meant that I often found myself needing more loot and ramming my face into every surface and mashing the use key until I accidentally found something that could be picked up or used.\n\nI will shoutout the mission A House of Locked Secrets though, it had a creative setup and a well executed gimmick that I'm not sure would be possible in Thief. It also helped that it took mostly place in an open ended area and had no specific loot requirement but instead focused on varied story objectives. It was very long like the other missions, but it felt like there was constant progress rather than just spending forever scouring every corner. It alone might make The Dark Mod worth trying, but personally I'm not going to dig any deeper for more gems like it when the other three missions I tried were less than enjoyable.",

  "comment": "Had Harvester come out today, it'd be another indie game trying to be weird for the sake of being weird and I'd ignore it without another thought, but having come out in the mid-90s adds another layer of weird that's probably the biggest curiosity the game has to offer.\n\nAs a game and not a relic from the 90s, Harvester is not very good. The puzzles aren't great, the things you do to advance the plot don't make sense even in the game's context and the last third just drags on unnecessarily. The individual characters, the voice acting and FMVs are entertaining, but that's about it.",

The combat feels like being a tank  that's trying to perform melee attacks with its turrent, the areas often lack any identifiable landmarks and consist of 1-2 textures making navigation awkward and visuals ugly, and making progress is usually a matter of random exploration that doesn't feel like progress as it's not clear what you were trying to accomplish in the first place. What finally made me quit was a boss near the end that was not only a ludicrous difficulty spike but also required clearing a boss rush just to try again.",

Didn't stop me from struggling with some of the early missions either way, and one mission with instakill moments was particularly annoying. Either way, it's an legitimately fun action game that from what I recall gets much better in co-op. The level select with multiple paths was also a nice little touch, but it's a real shame you can't revisit levels until after beating the game. I can imagine getting screwed over by making bad skill choices and being unable to level up further.",

As far as short and simple indie stealth games go, definitely one of the better ones.\n\nThe only major issue I have with it is the music, which is unremarkable ambience when in stealth but the moment you get spotted switches to a very loud track that works as a jump scare every single time. Would recommend muting the music and putting on Deus Ex/System Shock/Hitman Codename 47/Prey soundtracks which are more fitting anyway.",

Though for a game that has aged better, Sweet Home is the superior choice.\n- Extremely sluggish movement and combat made navigating the mansion really cumbersome. Especially the running mechanic was unreliable and clumsy.\n- The camera was often all over the place, setting the bar for many survival horror games to come\n- The puzzles were full on moon logic nonsense and at the end included a potential dead man walking situation\n- Horrible inventory management where you couldn't tell how much stuff you could carry or which items were important. That was especially annoying when dealing with books that contained information that you might want to refer back to later on.",

The atmosphere was top notch, the town didn't feel threatening but unnervingly unwelcoming.\n- The sanity effect and the injury systems were neat, and actually made a noticeable difference in gameplay\n- Some nice details in the environments and the complete lack of HUD helped to visuals too\n- After the Innsmouth township the quality began to steadily decline until it went completely off the rails in the final chapter\n- The AI was totally busted\n- The story worked up to a certain point. I wish it had been split between multiple characters, Jack sticking around after Innsmouth didn't really make sense.\n- Even if the unofficial patch had worked correctly, the cannon section still would've been terrible due to the awful mouse controls. The very end was also laughably bad with 30fps cap and lowered resolution being needed to get through it.\n- On rating: The first 4 hours are a 9, the rest are a 6",

Notably, the police station is neat but the RE1 mansion is better, and the resource management in RE1 is better.\n- The A/B scenarios were a very good addition and different enough from one another\n- Some great enemy designs, especially the lickers were a good fit\n- Often felt like there was no real goal to work towards other than \"explore the police station\", because that's what you do in a video game.

  "comment": "- Some creepy ghost designs and other visuals. The grainy, low resolution PS2 look really suits the survival horror genre.\n- Combat was interesting and never felt excessive despite numerous encounters. Fights mattered, and I'm a big fan of that. A couple of the fights towards the end were pretty bad, but most of the time combat was well above average in the genre.\n- Very good audio, and the directionality of it worked very well when trying to locate ghosts\n- \"Jump scares\" were great, no loud stingers but just a ghost suddenly being near you\n- The mansion design was nice, but there was a lot of back and forth especially when the objectives were unclear\n- The game tried to offer directions, but when it failed it was easy to get stuck in dumb ways\n- The camera and controls were often clumsy and it was easy to get stuck on invisible corners",

The grainy, low resolution look was a good fit.\n- Camera and combat were pretty clunky, switching to normal early on was the right choice\n- Puzzles were better than in SH1, but still had the same problem where you need to think the way the designer intended. This time they made mostly sense to me, but I can see other people getting stuck on them easily.\n- Born from a Wish was played on the PS3 HD remaster, holy heck that's a bad port",

  "comment": "- The setting is pretty cool and at least in theory much of it can be navigated using landmarks and signs\n- Nice selection of weapons, powers and environmental kills that in theory should make for interesting combat\n- In practice the combat is often a total clown fiesta where it's hard to tell what the hell is going on and then you die. It didn't help that the enemies were often unnecessarily tanky and had little in terms of hit feedback. Attempting to play on hard difficulty only made it way worse.\n- In practice navigating the world relies on one of the worst maps I can recall ever seeing. The rest of the UI isn't much better either.\n- The hacking minigame. Oh god the hacking minigame. It could've maybe been fine had the amount of hacking been reduced by 90% and had someone bothered to make sure that the puzzles are actually solvable.\n- The sounds were totally busted and it was impossible to properly track enemies around corners using it. This may be a Remastered issue, which would make sense because it's a damn poor remaster.\n- Someone should've tried telling Ken Levine that there are other ways of world building besides audio logs. It felt like the game never wanted to shut up and kept throwing unnecessary logs at you, even though it was nearly impossible to listen to them while trying to actually play the game at the same time.\n- Terrible ending sequence featuring an escort mission with a kid that never shuts up and a clusterfuck of a boss fight\n- If this was to receive a Dead Space -style full remake it could be good\n- Calling this an immersive sim is bloody dumb",

To be fair the TV show part was much better than the game part, maybe as a short series rather than a game this could've been good.\n- The TV show portion is streamed from Microsoft's servers so it's a single player game where you need to be online to watch cutscenes, and those cutscenes could be taken down any moment",

Guess that's at least partially on me for playing the PAL PS1 version.\n- The areas didn't really stand out from one another and often went on longer than they needed to\n- Puzzles and dungeons often lacked cohesive solutions and boiled down to \"walk through room to unlock another one\" or \"press buttons until door opens\"\n- Quality FMVs and lore",

While the overarching story was good, the moments in it felt mediocre\n- Combat was alright, but fell apart when fighting groups of enemies\n- An hour in a blacksmith glitched out and showed me a vision of what was going to happen 24 hours later.

  "comment": "- The movement and combat feel very good, it's especially nice how much destructible stuff there is to whack when just moving around\n- The art style and audio make for a gloomy but comfy atmosphere\n- The amount of backtracking and retracing steps is absurd. Since you can't mark points of interest on the map in an intelligible way and new areas are only drawn when resting, you end up checking the same places over and over. Which wouldn't be so bad if you could reach those places in an efficient manner, but there are only a very limited number of fast travel points that tend to be on the far edges of their respective areas, some areas have very limited paths to get around, and once you realize you've come to the wrong place there's no quick way out like a homeward bone.\n- I can't stress enough how much a better fast travel system would improve this. It would remove hours of repetitive traversal from the completion time and make exploration way more fun.\n- From what I've gathered, there appears to be some really intriguing optional stuff for people invested enough in the gameplay. I only got the basic ending and couldn't say a thing about the lore, but I got a lot of respect for any game that has the guts to hide seemingly significant chunks of itself behind obtuse, secret stuff. If I was more into 2D platforming I could see myself being very into what HK is doing.",

  "comment": "- The recompilation port and the tech behind it are the definition of black magic. No issues anywhere, and incredibly easy to use.\n- Great setting for the story, the moon crashing in three days is easily my favourite Zelda premise\n- Loads of similarities with OoT, meaning the the exploration and core gameplay loop are fairly simple and satisfying. Also meaning that occasionally the progression was somewhat obtuse.\n- Stone Tower was probably the best dungeon+boss combination in both this and OoT\n- The transformation masks were a good addition, but their movement based skills were too clumsy to control for some of the more precise sections\n- The bomber's notebook/sidequests were mostly interesting to explore, but the notebook itself was an awful tool for tracking anything and at worst gave misleading hints. Kafei in particular can heck right off.\n- Timeloops are cool and all, but this desperately needed a better way to control time to avoid spending minutes at a time waiting and doing nothing\n- OoT is probably the better game on a first playthrough, but MM is the one I'd rather replay as the second time through it's easier to avoid mistakes like deciding to do Kafei's quest",

Convoluted controls where almost every small action required either its own hotkey or Ctrl/Alt/Shift as a modifier, clumsy camera controls, extremely lacking object highlight options, and tutorials that missed a huge amount of key mechanics.",

The first 45 minutes were especially bad.\n- Environments looked nice, but were repetitive. Abstract mazes don't make for interesting objectives in the long run.",

  "comment": "- Turn based tactics is a pretty original take on stealth, and it works pretty well\n- Difficulty felt pretty nicely balanced based on the two runs I did, both runs were very close to a disaster but still made it all the way\n- Compared to Into the Breach, the undo mechanic was terrible and the UI was not as clear as I would've liked, led to a lot of mistakes due to misunderstandings. In general there's a lot of mechanics to learn, and you only learn them through mistakes.\n- I'm not into roguelikes enough to keep going after 2 runs, it didn't feel like there was a hook like in something like FTL. Feels like I saw everything already.",

  "comment": "- The Deathstorm missions were way too long for their own good, but Target Führer felt like a Hitman mission, as in short and replayable. TF was much more enjoyable in general than the 3 DS missions.\n- Sniping while considering wind, distance, etc is neat. Shame the game rarely gives a good chance to make the most of it.\n- The AI was way more punishing than I remembered, and not in a good way. Enemies were extremely sensitive to reacting any sort of tiny noise and then immediately spread that reaction to everything anywhere close to them.\n- Terrible difficulty system that has a ton of customization but doesn't elaborate on any of the settings or inform you that Authentic is practically unplayable without knowing the mission beforehand",

  "comment": "- Feels like someone in charge had a vision of how this was supposed to be, but failed to communicate that vision to anyone else\n- Surprisingly large and open-ish levels, but often still completely linear and nonsensical. It seems the devs knew that and tried to use weapon pick ups as waypoints to guide the player.\n- The story was okay, and turned into fun schlock towards the end\n- Ripped off Splinter Cell in a lot of ways but ripping off the always awful control stick angle based movement speed was a terrible mistake\n- Most of everything was kinda rubbish, but not terrible enough to ruin the basic functionality\n- So many pointless cutscenes, often literally a few steps from one another\n- The significance of the frozen wine eludes me",

The only polish this game has is the one meant for your boots that you wear on your face.\n- The final level was a drop in quality, too much hunting for items in unclear areas and repeating similar sections",

  "comment": "- One of the rare games that goes for the sounds/shadows stealth of Thief, and does it mostly well\n- Pretty good level design with different paths and a nice variety of locations\n- No mid-mission saves meant that a small mistake could be very costly and not in a fun way as you'd just end up repeating the exact same steps. I like having some limitations to saves to avoid save scumming, but this was not the right way to go about it.\n- Sound propagation didn't quite work in all situations, especially foot steps on metal were always very loud and it was practically impossible to tell which way people were moving or where the sound was coming from\n- I appreciate the fact that there was a rating system and that it was explained, just a shame the stealth portion of it was very binary",

  "comment": "- Gameplay was mostly great, lots of tools/AI interactions/mobility\n- Open world made for some interesting moments with weather/time of day/enemy behaviours, but it also added tons and tons of helicopter rides and pointless walking. Terrible tradeoff overall.\n- The story had a couple of ideas, but was ultimately very disjointed and lacked any sort of pacing, especially in chapter 2\n- Missions having opening credits that spoil the missions themselves is laughably stupid, but including level designers and writers in them is neat\n- Most things in the game added nothing of value. Mother Base, side ops, most \"story\" missions, Kaz's never ending monologues... Ground Zeroes was the way to go, keep it simple.\n- It's pretty shocking that a game can have this much stuff in it but still feel so hollow and unfinished\n- Hideo Kojima's MGSV, a Hideo Kojima game by Hideo Kojima",

Inventory full of unidentifiable items in an alien world does not work for that and a lot of the puzzles were terrible.\n- Most of the time there was no goal to work towards, just aimlessly trying everything on everything. At worst the main character seemed to know why he did a thing even when it wasn't at all apparent to the player.\n- At least it was shorter than The Longest Journey",

  "comment": "- Really interesting premise and overall a good story. Definitely more intriguing than SH1 or SH3.\n- The apartment has a great atmosphere, the PS2-limited art style with all the graininess works in its favor\n- The gameplay is ass. Somehow the combat feels worse than in the previous entries, and there's way too much of it.\n- Most enemies were just annoying, whether it was because there were too many of them, or because they were unkillable, or just bland. The twin victims being the exception in terms of design.\n- The second half is just awful. I can see how it could work in favor of the story with the unique ghosts, but the areas weren't interesting to explore the first time around so revisiting them is a chore.\n- The apartment and the story carry this pretty hard. I'd be lying if I said this was enjoyable to play, but the positive parts left more of an impression than the negative ones.\n- This is the SH that should get a remake. This one would need pretty significant changes to reach its full potential, whereas SH1 and SH3 mostly hold up as they are. Stealth gameplay needed to make the ghosts better and scarier enemies.",

Most post-apocalyptic worlds have at least some comfortable moments, but extreme cold sucks all the time.\n- I somehow got a win on the second attempt, but I can see how it would be very demotivating to lose and have to start over without enough knowledge to avoid making the same mistakes again\n- Seems there's a lot of replay value with different campaigns and going for a route that doesn't involve ruling the new world as the God King. Being a dictator was fun though.",

  "comment": "- The art style was pretty neat, especially some of the enemy designs\n- The on-rails movement was pretty unique and worked well enough in the context of the game\n- The combat was awful, especially on a controller. Aiming at the weak points feels extremely clumsy and gets old fast. It might've been fine if it wasn't for the enemies constantly respawning.\n- Some of the worst bosses I've ever seen. If I ever complain about a boss being bad in any game, please remind me of the brainy men of killer7.\n- The puzzles were like something a 6-year old would design. A quiz about posters within the same room was one of the low points. Once I realized that the map gives solutions to some the puzzles before you even get to them they got a little more bearable.\n- The map was vital for making progress, but it also failed to mark the player location or connect areas to one another properly, making it frustrating to work with\n- The way characters talked was extremely obnoxious. Everyone talks in riddles one line at a time with no way to speed it up. It was a challenge not to zone out whenever the gimp repeated how tight the spot was. This feels like a nitpick, but it was an issue all the way through the game.\n- There may have been a seed for a decent story, but the storytelling failed it entirely. The best parts were missions that were seemingly totally unrelated to the main plotline.\n- It felt like an artsy student project from itch.io that somehow got released as a full game",

Also a lot of seeminly aimless running around while trying to figure out what to do.\n- Looked better than I expected from a PS2 game",

It also felt like the only part where there was a real story goal to work towards.\n- Maybe has replay value thanks to the choices and somewhat random encounters and resources. But at the same time, the (supposedly with no regard to balancing) random resources seem like a really bad way to handle difficulty.\n- Even though in RE1 and 2 you did a lot of back and forth in the mansion and the police station, it didn't feel like you were backtracking. In RE3 almost every section felt heavy on backtracking, especially the streets early on.\n- The combat wasn't great, the dodge system in particular was awful",

Most of them were enjoyable, but sometimes you got a Nightmare 3.\n- Seems like a good game to replay after getting good at the combat\n- The camera was the strongest enemy, some of the most difficult fights were hard because the camera couldn't keep up\n- The yellow orbs were a really dumb way to handle mid-mission checkpoints\n- Getting the final weapon kinda messed with the weapon systems by removing quick switching and by being too similar to one of the old weapons\n- Could've done a bit more to teach some basics, I did not have a manual and tips from the chat definitely helped a lot",

For the last 25% I switched to easy because there was no option to switch to normal. Even on easy the game was still tedious at that point.\n- The stuff with the difficulty modes definitely soured the game for me, with hard being bullshit, easy being tedious and there being no option to switch to normal\n- The combat started off pretty good, but as the game went on enemies got tankier and started appearing in giant, respawning mobs and having attacks that could interrupt you without warning\n- Platforming and climbing were clumsy\n- Due to the tanky and respawning mobs, got very repetitive as it went on. Could've used more bosses or anything to mix things up more.\n- Crunchiest sound quality in a long while\n- Visually pretty nice, especially for the PS2. The cutscenes in particular were stylish.",

  "comment": "- The PC source port is excellent, there's no going back to N64's low resolution and framerate and limited controls after this\n- The first child section felt a little mundane, but that in a way worked in the favour of the later parts as it helped make the stakes feel higher when things started happening. It got the player accustomed to the world and added weight to the key events.\n- One gamey ass game, the dungeons felt very much like puzzle compilations that require just enough thinking to get through rather than actual temples. Not a good or a bad thing, it worked for the gameplay as long as you didn't think about it too much.\n- Sometimes the progression was a bit obtuse and required seemingly optional things to get done, and Navi as a built-in hint system was useless. Would've been interesting to be able to play this truly blind to get a truer view of some of the sections.\n- The combat and the targeting system in particular were not great\n- Ganon's Castle's first area and the associated dungeon item were really poorly handled",

  "comment": "(Played with the unofficial patch, without restored content)\n\n- Really good cast of characters, the writing, the voice acting and the animations made it a joy to interact with them\n- Most of the quests were unique, well paced and had interesting locations\n- Gameplay was more basic than in something like Deus Ex, but it didn't feel like a hinderance\n- Surprising amount of clan-specific dialog for the Nosferatu, it was fun to see people's first impressions\n- Main quest felt somewhat linear and I don't think it needed to, a few lines of dialogue could've made a big difference\n- Very good music, though the audio balancing was a bit off at times\n- When the quests were bad, they were borderline unplayable and somehow that was most often a thing in the combat heavy main story quests (sewers, Sabbat hideout, final stretch)\n- In combat, skills/attributes/whatever felt useless compared to disciplines\n- General early Source engine jank, especially if there were physics objects on the ground\n- A bad build can be a death sentence and it might be too late by the time you find out",

Episode 3 on the other hand was far better than any of the other ones, both in terms of setting and gameplay.\n- Doom 64 is still my favorite of the few boomer shooters I've played and I don't really get the hype around Blood as whole, but episode 3 is maybe my favorite set of levels in these games.",

N-Gage remains as the superior phone for games.\n- Oh yeah the solution system and the undo button are paywalled! Got stuck for the third time? Pay up buddy. Want to continue using the basic quality of life feature of undoing a single move? Better have your wallet nearby. This used to be a paid game too, but I'm not sure if the microtransactions were there back then. Absolute scum either way, even at their best mobile games are terrible.\n- I only played this because it's getting delisted entirely and I maintain that erasing games like that is worse than anything this game did, preservation is important. This could've even been a decent game had some greedy executive not been thinking of ways to ruin it.",

I like bringing out the pen and the paper, but I think some way to tag people (\"tattoo guy\", \"dude with books\") would've been nice for example. I also feel like I ended up abusing the way the game confirmed the guesses and solved a lot of \"unsolvable\" fates early on, which kinda worked as part of the puzzle but also felt a bit cheap.\n- The way the progression works is not well communicated and made for a very frustrating first hour when I didn't understand it, and even later on it felt unnecessarily tedious. At times it even felt like pixel hunting was involved, which is why I got stuck and solved an excessive amount of fates early on.",

  "comment": "- Made it almost halfway through chapter 2 out of 6 before hitting the point where I could no longer continue without either grinding or doing multiplayer crap.\n- It's possible the menus were broken because I got the feeling that the game was definitely designed with microtransactions in mind with all the grindy and lootboxy trash, but the store only used in game currency and the button to buy more of that led to the same page, making using real money impossible. I guess I'll take that as a positive thing?\n- Sniping inherently requires a lot of precision. Touch screen controls are inherently imprecise. Playing it is like trying to thread a needle while wearing mittens. The concept was broken from the get go, it just isn't fun to play.\n- Mobile games are the worst trash there is but like Deus Ex GO, this should still be preserved",

Both were still a net positive though.\n- Nintendo needs to get their head out of their ass and let Nightdive remaster this",

Hopefully a patch/remaster can happen and some polish can be added, this understandably had a difficult development cycle.\n- Better as a spooky detective game than the original, but also less fun with things like breakdancing Holmes and insane Moriarty getting cut",

  "comment": "- Great bosses with good patterns and very good use of a dynamic soundtrack\n- Very over the top in just the right way, Platinum understood the assignment\n- The combat was fun, but also seemed fairly forgiving. A lot of the time I was just pressing buttons at random and it was more than good enough.\n- Too easy? I'm bad at these games but because of the leniency, attack and block being in the same button and a huge supply of medkits I still had to handicap myself pretty hard to get a good challenge. Overall it the difficulty balancing felt off and the most fair and challenging setup seemed to be Hard with the self imposed rule of not using medkits.\n- Stick wiggle to escape grabs was either way too precise or just broken, and I had more luck switching to WASD when grabbed than using the stick. It's a terrible mechanic that actively drags down the rest of the combat system and I hope whoever came up with it feels bad.\n- The Blade Wolf DLC was pretty bad, and the Sam DLC was pretty good outside of the last boss",

The original's UI was excellent once you got used to it, this was mediocre at best.\n- Terrible combat with no hit feedback in either direction, especially in melee\n- The final stretch was full of awful bosses and big fights, including the anticlimactic SHODAN fight\n- The good things were already good in the original.

Even bricks were a big thing to consider.\n- Terrible, terrible ending in a true Frictional fashion. Most of the game was a solid 9/10 but the ending was a 1/10.\n- Load zones didn't work quite as well as one could've hoped for, making the monster work awkwardly\n- The monster being on a leash was too apparent and at times made attempts at stealth frustrating, especially since there weren't many hiding places to work with. The monster was also pretty hard to track properly, adding to both the horror and the frustration.\n- Insane that Frictional managed to make a full blown survival horror immersive sim after each of their previous games being closer and closer to walking sims\n- Might at some point replace Alien Isolation as my go-to example of stealth in a horror game. The stealth was worse but the horror was better.",

Very hectic from the get go and a little absurd in its pace.\n- The alien campaign was the weakest. Way too many cheap moments where you took tons of damage that you just had to get lucky to get past.\n- The predator campaign was okay. I wish it had been even more of a power trip after playing as the weak xenomorph but it was still fine.",

Had it been either a hard to trigger post-credits section or less obtuse in general it would've been more enjoyable.\n- More linear and mission based than I hoped.

Makes Lucius 2 look like finished game.\n- It was impossible to take 10 steps without something breaking. Especially the map/mission generation was absurdly broken, building levels with multiple kinds of softlocks and unplayable scenarios.\n- The final mission would not load in a playable state 80% of the time and ran at 20fps, forcing me to give up after about 10 attempts\n- Feels bad for the devs, this is clearly not what they wanted to release. Then again, it's 20€ which feels like a robbery.",

  "comment": "- Good setting, though the story could've been communicated better\n- Unique feeling mix of metroidvania, JRPG and survival horror\n- The Resident Evil connection is clear with the limited inventory and interconnected map, but since there was no central storage managing items was closer to Goof Troop. It wasn't too bad when referring to a guide, but it would definitely have been annoying to start backtracking for an item you previously thought was useless.\n- Menus were pretty clumsy, especially when trying to figure out what weapons to use\n- Very easy, the combat didn't have much depth and saving anywhere meant there was no need to take risks. Using a guide surely played a part too, but I feel like it mostly reduced annoyances rather than difficulty.\n- Far exceeded my expectations for a NES game. Obviously it feels outdated in many ways, but when played as a handheld game with a guide I had a good time and think it was worth a playthrough just to see some of survival horror's roots.",

  "comment": "The storyline didn't feel like it was going anywhere and the gameplay felt very combat focused, which is a shame because the combat wasn't very good. Maybe later on with more skills and spells the fights could become interesting, but when 5 hours in only 2 out of the 6 characters had hit level 2, I couldn't bring myself to continue with the way things were looking. I prefer my combat encounters being rare but memorable, and BG seemed to be going for the opposite. I would much rather spend an hour talking to random tavern goers in Planescape Torment than slaughtering kobolds in Baldur's Gate.",

  "comment": "- Probably the best stealth tactics game out there, overtaking Desperados 3. Very good gameplay overall, felt like the next logical step for the genre.\n- The characters felt equally overpowered in a good way, all of them had their upsides and it was hard to have a bad team setup\n- Mission length and difficulty was toned down compared to other games in the genre, which is only a good thing since these games tend to be very hard and have very long missions\n- Because characters could be unlocked in any order and islands were reused for several missions and could be done in any order, there were very few good, memorable setpiece missions that stood out from the rest. In contrast, I still remember a lot of Desperados 3 missions because the environments and team compositions were specifically designed for their respective missions.",

  "comment": "- The combat was improved from the already good DMC1. Styles were a good addition and especially Royal Guard was fun to use, but it would've been nice if switching between them wasn't so limited.\n- The additional weapons didn't feel as good as Rebellion, but still had occasional uses. Nevan in particular was unique, but sadly also controlled very poorly.\n- Good enemy and boss designs, almost all bosses made for good fights or at least added variety. The only notable exception was Arkham.\n- The writing was absolutely full of edgy cheese, in the best possible way\n- Dreadful camera. I get that having the camera be close to the action makes everything feel more intense, but way too often the enemies were out of sight.",

No distractions or tools, despite focus on shadows and sounds it mostly played like a line of sight based game.\n- Health as a energy resource is a nice idea, but it was only used to avoid sounds which was rarely an issue to begin with\n- The hold up mechanic was disappointing as there were no interactions beyond the initial hold up. You couldn't take guns, move held up enemies or efficiently use them as bait.\n- The supposed message/theme did not come across at all",

No randomization on reset, no Sixth Sense, worse detection mechanics and indicator, no limit on zipties.\n- Crowd control seems to be more about trading hostages and delaying the assault rather than trying to stop the alarm from kicking in in the first place, which is disappointing\n- The Hitman-esque challenge/progression system was full of uninspired challenges that were impossible to sift through and sometimes failed to unlock correctly\n- The replay value Payday 2 had doesn't seem to be there as there's no randomization on reset and even when you do go through matchmaking for a different seed the differences feel small\n- Lots of small issues like poor favor systems, clumsy hacking/mini cameras, lacking audio cues/footstep sounds for NPCs, terrible vaulting mechanic\n- Always online.

  "comment": "- I'm no graphics enthusiast and had everything set to low, but damn this game looked horrendous and didn't run well either. The lighting in particular was borderline broken, with time of day affecting even windowless rooms.\n- The sounds were very bad, walls did not affect sound propagation at all so attempting to track NPCs by their sounds was a total waste of time\n- The skill tree and progression system were completely pointless as you had to do almost everything in a very specific order anyway and could only spend skill points in set ways. Cheating to get extra XP and money actually made the gameplay feel a bit less linear and boring.\n- The story was a series of unrelated fetch quests with no interesting twists or missions, aside from maybe the heists\n- The gameplay was a complete copy+paste from Thief Sim 1, which wasn't great to begin with. Like in TS1, ideas like tracking tenants' schedules were nice, but needed to be way more fleshed out. As it is, this feels like an asset flip of TS1.\n- Streamer mode is totally busted and does the opposite it's supposed to do. It replaces the soundtrack with a bunch of poorly fitting Kevin MacLeod (uncredited...) tracks that DO get muted on Twitch, while the non-streamer mode soundtrack doesn't get muted.",

The rest ranged from passable to terrible.\n- Squirrel Stapler being a better stealth game than some actual stealth games was a nice surprise. Great sound design.",

Encouraged creativity in a similar way that Hitman missions do.\n- Looked and sounded good. Some of the best looking snow in video games.\n- Impressive tech that handled a ton of destruction even on my old toaster with very few framerate issues\n- Intricate maps that were reused appropriately\n- DLCs: Art Vandals is alright for a free modding demo.

Personally I didn't like Thief Gold's levels that much, and Black Parade reminded me of those.\n- Maybe this was the case in the actual Thief games as well, but the platforming and especially dealing with marble floors was often infuriating. I get that marble is supposed to be very loud and challenging to work around, but guards on the Moon reacting to every tiny step was just obnoxious.\n- One of the missions gave me nice Demon's Souls vibes and while not making the most of Thief's gameplay, stood out from the rest in a good way. Could've been shorter though, the second half felt a bit like a repeat of Mage Towers.",

The focus was on getting close to the enemies rather than in shooting from afar.\n- Maps are large and kinda open, but also riddled with invisible walls and other dumb barriers\n- Movement controls were very sluggish, especially the cover and climbing systems were frustrating to work with\n- This series is in a desperate need of a reboot. SE5 is mostly good but not the same kind of improvement as the previous instalments have been and there is no more gas in the tank. There's nothing unique about the series as this point and I wish it would fully focus on hardcore sniping instead of being a jack of all trades.",

The missions are excessively linear, the abilities are bland, the save system barely works and the bugs make the gameplay inconsistent.\n- Terrible as a Stargate game. You never go through the gate, the staff weapon is only used for melee, the scientist is an idiot, three shots disintegrates, practically no connection to the series outside of the first mission. Why would you ever have a character called \"Sam\" who isn't Carter?\n- Embarrassingly unprofessional launch. Delaying the release by 5 weeks without announcing it until after the initial release and pretending this isn't early access when the second half of the game doesn't even have a release date should not be acceptable.\n- I really like Stargate and I really like stealth tactics games but I really don't like this game",

  "comment": "- Original setting and pretty good shooting\n- Looks, sounds and plays well\n- Missions feel distinct and the way they're connected to one another is neat. Only towards the end the quality started falter due to over reliance on the hover mechanic.\n- Unfortunately when missions are revisited they don't feel different from the first time through despite the new abilities\n- The checkpoint system is a little rough, but works. I like not relying on quicksaves, though there are definitely unfair feeling moments where a manual save would be nice. Not being able to use the same checkpoint twice in a row also seems odd.\n- The random pickups from pots are bad. There seems to be no balancing whatsoever so you might just not get any health or ammo when you need it, and it does feel dumb having to be careful about every pot as you never know if it contains a health pickup or a trap.",

The enemies having voicelines and ragdolls also made it more fun.\n- Lots of variety in scenarios, from more linear corridor based combat to large open spaces with multiple factions fighting each other. Even The Library had its purpose, even if it went on longer than necessary.\n- Two weapon limit is weapon durability done right\n- Good mission/chapter/level titles are underrated, and Halo has some of the best ones. Though I do wish the main titles (not the mid-chapter titles) were more clearly presented.\n- I like revisiting levels, but a lot of the levels felt copy-pasted and uninspired\n- The original graphics looked generally better than the updated ones, but being able to switch on the fly was cool",

The puzzles are good, the pacing is good, the locations look great, all in all it's an extremely polished mod.\n\nThe flaws are also straight from P2. Sometimes the puzzles devolve into \"find the portal-able surface\", and the sidekick tries too hard to be funny.",

  "comment": "- A very good but pointless remake. The original still holds up and the remake is so faithful to it that it barely adds anything new to the experience.\n- Most of the changes were for the better and I'd call this an improvement over the original, but there was very little \"new\" to see here\n- Weapons were much better than in the original. Each one I used had a different purpose and even the ones I didn't use seemed alright.\n- Isaac talking was an unexpectedly good thing. I was initially against it but it wasn't overdone and allowed him to be more of an engineer.\n- Flamethrowering the dividers had a real The Thing -esque feel to it which I very much enjoyed\n- Zero-G felt clumsy compared to the original, even if it gave you more freedom\n- The way the Ishimura was more interconnected than before is neat, but I do miss how the tram bookended each chapter in the original\n- The claims of the performance being stuttery regardless of components are greatly exaggerated, the PC version runs fine. The biggest issue I had was being unable to bind \"heal\" and \"skip audiolog\" to different buttons.\n- The lore and story were made more sensical, but sadly towards the end started to set up for the nonsense that Dead Space 2 requires",

  "comment": "- More of a resource management game than an RPG. Even in the dungeon sections managing SP was more important than fighting enemies.\n- Very comfy, at least while it still feels fresh. Plays well, looks and sounds great, the combat has the right amount of depth.\n- Enough quality of life features that allow even me to get into it. Quick retrys, fast travel, clear and informative UI, tracking of how you're doing compared to other players etc.\n- Very easy on Normal. I'm no JRPG person so I didn't want to up the difficulty, but the longer the game went on the less combat I did because it just wasn't challenging and I figured the bosses might be more interesting if I'm a little underleveled.\n- It's hard to follow how different stats make a difference to anything as they change so often and the combat is largely focused on using weaknesses. I kept making the numbers go up, but couldn't tell if that was important in the grand scheme of things.\n- Way, way, WAY too long. During the first half new mechanics kept popping up and choices had to be made regarding resources, but in the second half the novelty of the combat wore off, resources got maxed out and the daily routines dragged on. Especially around the mid point of the game there was a long stretch where almost nothing was going on.",

The little story that there was wasn't communicated well either.\n- Clumsy combat that was best avoided\n- Bad exploration as the areas were narrow, linear, and still hard to navigate due to the low field of view\n- The whole last area was a collection of softlocks, bad checkpoints, terrible bossfights and audio bugs",

Or not.\n- Does look pretty\n- Remedy + Poets of the Fall always works\n- Combat still wasn't great, especially aiming the flashlight felt clunky\n- Alan's lamp and writer's room were cool ideas, but a bit inconsistent and awkward in practice. Same with Saga's mind place.\n- Some video game tropes that really didn't need to be there, like open world collectibles and especially tracking them so the player can avoid missing them. It would've fit better if whatever stuff is in the world is more easily missed or not there at all.\n- Really awesome that Remedy got the opportunity to go full weird like this\n- Finland. David Lynch. Max Payne. House of Leaves. In the Mouth of Madness.\n- Night Springs DLC: Pretty great, especially the Rose episode. I like it when DLC is disconnected from the main game like this. Just let the main game be done.\n- The Lake House DLC: It's alright, a Control side story with Alan Wake's gameplay and atmosphere.",

Doesn't really fit the universe either, somehow in the capitalist dystopia people aren't allowed to work more than 15 minutes a day.",

Instakill pits out of nowhere, entering a room 20 times to pick up items, trying all 8 keycards on all doors.\n- Side scrolling sections were almost a nice twist, if only they hadn't been awful every single time\n- Despite its reputation, not considerably worse than the MSX2 games. Maybe even sneakier than those two?\n- The most bare bones port imaginable (Master Collection), as expected from Konami\n- Kojima wasn't involved but shall take the blame regardless",

Still has really good pacing and variety thanks to all the weapon and enemy types, factions and various scenarios that mix all of those.\n- The updated graphics were generally a step up\n- Many of the areas still felt copy-pasted, especially in some of the Arbiter missions\n- The story felt rushed. Because of the character swapping it felt like some characters just arbitrarily showed up in placed, and the ending was disappointing.",

The combat was never a threat and almost entirely avoidable with no effort, and the quests (while well written) felt mechanically formulaic.\n- Despite the exploration starting off great, it got staler and staler as the game went on and the rewards got less and less meaningful\n- Awful lockpicking system",

  "comment": "Very much not my type of game so it took a while to get used to the visual business and to get over the Xbox controller's right stick being uncomfortable to hold for extended periods of time. I did enjoy the game well enough for most of it, but the way power ups work sucked a lot out of it.\n\nExperienced mode starting with 99 continues seems like it may as well be infinite, but a single death can put you in a really nasty feedback loop. On death you drop some power ups and then when you try to recover those dropped power ups you die again, losing even more power ups, until you're stuck in a situation where you have nothing left and just die repeatedly due to the lack of both offensive and defensive options. I don't think I ever lost a single continue on my Experienced run, they were all lost in clusters while trying to recover.\n\nThat still could've been fine, if it wasn't for the final boss. What an absurd difficulty spike that threw in attacks unlike any other enemy so far, some of which were just about unavoidable without power ups, which I obviously didn't have after the first few deaths. I don't know if this sort of systems and difficulty spikes are the norm in games like this, but if they are, I fully understand why these are a niche thing.",

  "comment": "- The puzzles were definitely made with quantity rather than quality in mind and range from \"barely functional\" to \"pretty clever\" and with a lot of non-puzzles in between. It's not necessary a bad thing either, sometimes solving a bunch of trivial \"puzzles\" is what you need.\n- The world looks nice which adds to the comfy little-thinking-required puzzles\n- The UI is dreadful, bloated, and detracts from the comfy feel. It made tracking things clumsy and made me not want to continue after finishing the main quest.\n- The supposed multiplayer aspect adds exactly nothing to the game. At least it's getting an offline mode.",

  "comment": "- Felt extremely close to Mimimi's games to the extent that I though it might be using the same framework (this is a good thing). Not quite as polished at times, but the very fast save/load times make up for it.\n- Pretty good set of characters and abilities. Even if I didn't use all of them it wouldn't surprise me if even the \"bad\" ones could be used in ways I didn't think of.\n- Banger soundtrack\n- Difficulty balancing was a bit off. Sometimes you could effortlessly clear entirely rooms with a single character, sometimes you needed extra precise timing with the entire team. Might be at least partially an issue with Hard mode where enemies spot you so fast that the setting that slows down time when you're about to be spotted becomes useless.\n- The challenges were uninteresting. Getting experience pickups from missions was a good way to make the player explore most of the map, but also in a way defeated the idea of having multiple paths through the maps.",

Supposedly it gets better with cancels and such, but I think if those are needed to make the combat good, it wasn't good to begin with.\n- Weapon/spell options being so important but also being based on random drops is pretty messed up\n- Excellent PC port, especially the ability to rewind is a great addition that helps avoid losing lots of progress due to silly mistakes",

All the effects and foreground objects making it hard to see what was going on didn't help.\n- The second dungeon was the weakest part with an obnoxious gimmick, while the last dungeon was the highlight as it had very little combat and a lot of bashing",

There was rarely a good sense of scale of what was being traversed and some more landmarks could've gone a long way to help with that. The chapters were also like 30% longer than they needed to be.\n- It was sometimes really hard to tell where the right direction was and the best way to tell what the wrong path was, was to go in some direction, die, and realize you never got a checkpoint\n- The final level could've been good if it was shorter, less full of dumb death traps and didn't rely on a brand new mechanic",

  "comment": "- Some actually original and interesting stealth mechanics like silently opening doors, managing asthma, avoiding murder grass and the ambient noise system from Chaos Theory\n- The stealth arenas were good and had tension to them\n- At least as a streamer, mic getting picked up by the game added to immersion\n- Very linear and game-y with the most hilarious take on yellow paint (which can be disabled) I've ever seen and an absurd amount of loud stingers for a game that's supposed to be about being quiet\n- Uninteresting story\n- It's no Alien: Isolation or Amnesia: The Bunker but for a licensed stealth horror game, gets respectably close",

Not only did it go for the brown'n'bloom visuals, but replacing the shield gauge with a bloody screen meant that often during combat everything looked like a mess.",

Also no equipment farming that DoS suffered from.\n- The art and music are, as expected, a far cry from SotN. It's a shame the series went on only on handhelds.\n- The boss fights required for the true ending were irredeemably bad and I'm glad I cheated my way through them. Not worth the effort otherwise. Seriously left a bad taste in my mouth and spoiled the otherwise good game. Could've even been a 7/10.",

  "comment": "- I went into this expecting a bad stealth game, but there was actually very little stealth and in reality this was mostly a very bad Prince of Persia clone\n- I can't emphasize enough how poor the controls and basic movement were\n- The little stealth there was was extremely rudimentary\n- Bad performance all the way through\n- The story was completely pointless\n- The spiders could navigate between walls and floors, that's a little impressive\n- WHAT DOES \"BEASTS\" MEAN, PRECIOUS, WHAT DOES IT MEAN??",

  "comment": "- At the time of review: 16 wins, 90% collection, highest win on purple stake\n- Great as a mobile game, far better than any of the actual mobile games I've tried\n- Once it gets going, optimizing the deck is interesting and satisfying\n- Like with most roguelikes, the first parts of each playthrough are braindead boring. Especially on higher difficulties.\n- Relies too much on luck rather than strategy. Sure you can mitigate the luck factor by going for some safer strats, but that also makes the game more boring. \n- Update, July 2025: The more I play the more obvious it becomes that this would be way more fun if you could just skip ante 1 and start from ante 2 with two semi-random tags. Skipping the first blinds to get tags is the obvious opening play, but some of the tags are just not worth starting with.",

  "comment": "- Really makes me appreciate how much something like Brotato iterated and improved on the concept\n- Does get better as more things are unlocked and as you learn (look up) the evolution combinations\n- Seems there might be some fairly interesting secrets to be found, I discovered one but lost interest in the game soon after anyway\n- The UI is absolutely terrible, not only is it unresponsive but it also hides a lot of the relevant information (weapon levels, evolution combinations) exactly when it would be useful, or doesn't show it at all\n- Excruciatingly slow in every regard. Default movement speed, giant levels, excessively long loot animations, and long round time all contribute to this.\n- In a typical run, nothing interesting happens in the first 10 minutes because it takes a while to get items, the middle 10 minutes are actually interesting as you can optimize the level ups and have enough tools to actively fight the enemies, and the last 10 minutes are spent doing very little as the items get maxed out and all you can do is wait until the game ends in either victory or defeat. I don't get why the default round time is 30 minutes when so much of it is just boring.",

  "comment": "- Good combat that required intentionality with a nice variety of weapons\n- Platforming was by far the best in the series so far\n- Visuals and sounds were fitting and stylish. A lot of distinct looking areas.\n- Writing ranged from okay to so bad it's funny. And that's a good thing. I wish it had been more cringy.\n- The camera kept getting stuck on things in a really awkward way\n- Colour coded enemies hurt the combat by removing most weapon options\n- Vergil's Downfall: Vergil's moveset isn't as good as Dante's. One bossfight that's better than the ones in the base game. Sometimes broken in really funny ways.",

The unarmed zombies seem to be treated as a threat despite them being completely harmless.\n- Because of the respawn system, dying isn't even an inconvenience, it's a free health refill. There was no tension in the combat as a result.\n- Played most on very hard and only dropped to hard at the final level after one attempt, I was quite done with the game at that point",

Only towards the end the freedom fighting sections start to really drag on.\n- Weapons are a mixed bag. The shotgun and the revolver for instance were good, but the more rapid firing weapons were too inaccurate to be really fun to use. Especially when fighting the tankier Combine soldiers who didn't seem to care about getting hit.\n- The flashlight having limited power and also sharing that power with sprinting and diving felt dumb and unnecessary\n- While the physics were fun in combat situations with the gravity gun, there were definitely a lot of tech demo feeling moments with the puzzles",

Especially the second half is just forgettable.\n- Combat and weapons are still mediocre, but at least there's more focus on indirect ways of fighting\n- The parking garage was annoying but in a deliberate way and I kind of like how it's stressful in a different way compared to anything in the base game.

Especially the horde maps stood out as something different, and also as a difficulty spike.\n- Both games are good fun in co-op and almost equally good. The reason I think OC2 has the edge is because we started with OC2 and played OC1 between its main campaign and the seasonal levels, which made polish more noticeable.",

  "comment": "- The spellcasting system is really inventive yet simple. Early on just throwing rocks felt like a solution to everything, but even towards the end whole new spell types kept coming up.\n- Funny kind of stupid humor, largely carried by the mangled swedish/danish/whateverish dialogue\n- The difficulty spike near the end was a little ridiculous. Maybe it was partially due to only having two players and using controllers, but the sudden amount of instakill situations felt rough. Then again, it really forced us to come up with new strats to survive.\n- Needing an unofficial patch just to make the game crash less says something about the technical issues\n- After understanding the controls, controlled surprisingly well with a Steam controller",

Great addition.\n- Doom gameplay is still very good, but the enemies and super shotgun from Doom 2 are sorely missed\n- You can somewhat tell that this has some horror game roots as it seems reluctant to give you ammo for the bigger guns and scarcely uses tougher enemies. Lots of jump scare -esque monster closets too.\n- The level design is... not great. Lots of needlessly maze-like areas and \"something happened somewhere\" -triggers. At worst said triggers aren't even tied to switches but to walking into some arbitrary spot. Mt. Erebus was the highlight map for me as it was more open than most and had a hefty amount of enemies and ammo to work with.\n- It kinda reminds me of Thief 1, which also had excellent gameplay but the level design didn't make a great use of it",

Shame that the spellcrafting mechanic requires doing so much of the mage's guild.\n- Terrible performance and buggy as hell\n- Stealth with invisibility spells is the most broken \"stealth\" I've ever seen, to the point where it doesn't feel like sneaking\n- The main story is pretty decent, especially the premise is good. Does lose steam in the latter half due to fetch quests though. Also the engine clearly can't handle the kind of spectacle the story was going for.\n- Terrible performance and buggy as hell",

The rating is only for single player, multiplayer is obviously better.\n- Deathmatch is alright, though looking for guns after respawning can be annoying\n- Domination is easily the best mode. More structured than DM and the bots are competent enough to handle it.\n- UT's take on Capture the Flag is the worst one I've ever seen and in the running for one of the worst versus modes in general. No time limit, instant respawns, and instant flag returns create a formula for endless stalemates.\n- Assault is an interesting gimmick, but clearly too much for the bots to handle\n- The map quality ranges from excellent to terrible, and I felt no shame turning god mode on in some of the worst offenders",

  "comment": "- Very polished for what it is\n- The story, while well presented, doesn't seem to go anywhere. At least in the first half it felt like nothing important happened since the opening.\n- The gameplay is very linear and limited. Technically it has similarities to Desperados or Shadow Gambit, but each character only has one ability and each room only has one entrance, and at least for the first half of the game you mostly just have one character at a time.\n- A better comparison would be A Plague Tale, another very linear story driven game with limited stealth. Ultimately, both just ended up being boring to me.\n\n",

But that also meant that there was very little depth or challenge in any given section.\n- The characters never stopped talking or yelling and were overly quippy. Most of the humor didn't land for me.\n- The scene with Cutie is genuinely one of the most horrifying scenes in any game (even if the character decisions leading up to it doesn't make a lot of sense)",

  "comment": "- The story had a bit of a slow start in the first playthrough, but does get interesting around the halfway mark, is good overall\n- The ending sets up NG+ in a really interesting way, but it's a trap that doesn't pay off. The gameplay isn't good enough to warrant going through a nearly identical playthrough of a fairly long and linear game. The story didn't go into a more interesting direction either.\n- Especially in some of the town sections, the atmosphere was really nice. But it never reached the heights of the PS2 games as all the low resolution graininess was replaced by UE5 stuttering. Also sadly there were a quite a few jump scares that didn't feel very SH to me.\n- It didn't feel like there was a proper vision behind the combat design. On one hand it wanted to be an action game with perfect dodges and counters and focus systems, but some of the mechanics were completely absent on Story difficulty, which clearly is the preferred setting. Feels like there should be some middle ground that makes use of all the mechanics but makes the enemies, especially the titty monsters, have less health.\n- Could've used way less combat in general to give room for atmosphere building. The monsters stopped being threatening and the gameplay got dull, especially during NG+.\n- Inventory management was an unnecessary system. Most of the items were only there to be used as offerings, which didn't feel that meaningful. Maybe it's more important on Hard combat difficulty, but why would anyone want to play that way?\n- Some of the puzzle solutions made no sense, which appears to be a localization issue as at least one of them was easier on a higher difficulty. Bit of a mixed bag in terms of puzzles, some very good (hidden shrine) some very bad (scarecrow).\n- The school was the highlight with appropriate mix of combat, puzzles, exploration, and backstory.  I especially liked how the main puzzle tied into the school setting.",

  "comment": "- The good parts of the original are still mostly there. The camo system is still the best one out there. Lots of variety, whether it comes from different environments, boss fights, or gimmicky sections. Coherent story and reasonable cutscene lengths by Metal Gear standards.\n- The End and The Boss are some of the best stealth bosses out there\n- Required a mod to get the field of view and camera to a reasonable state\n- The very clumsy movement and controls are an endless source of frustration. Just walking around is painful as you get stuck on things due to the automatic cover system, and there's a lack any sort of precision when simply trying to turn around.\n- A faster camouflage change menu is a nice improvement, but what this game really needed was a complete overhaul of the camo system so you're not encouraged to switch every three meters.\n- The Pain lived up to his name by being utter garbage, not least because of the dreadful swimming mechanics. Might take the \"worst boss\" title from the killer7 brainy men.\n- Maybe this is a skill issue, but there seemed to be no indication of enemy positions at all, be it barks, footsteps, or anything else. The camera was also too janky to be used to look around properly. Either I suck, or figuring out enemy positions involves a lot of trial and error.\n- The original had some gameplay flaws (using the PS2's pressure sensitive buttons, excessive menuing when healing...) and Delta isn't an improvement, it just replaces some of the problems with different, worse ones. Beyond the small changes, it's a one-to-one, absolutely pointless remake (if it even is a remake). A downgrade more than anything.\n- Just play the Master Collection version of the original. Or the 3DS version. They're probably better.",
